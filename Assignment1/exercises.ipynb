    "First, choosing a small value for α is not appropriate, because too much weight would be given to the “uniform” part of A(α). The iterative algorithms that approximate PageRank converge quickly if α = 0.85. If α becomes larger, it require more iterations to converge. Moreover, numeric instability arises when α is too close to 1."
